The data had 449,371 observations and 255 variables. It looks like teams have indeed embraced throwing the football because 41.5% of the plays between 2009-2018 were ‘pass’ plays and 29.5% were ‘run’ plays.\n\nnfl_plays %&gt;% \n  count(play_type) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percent=n*100/sum(n))\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n   play_type        n percent\n   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 extra_point  10934   2.43 \n 2 field_goal    9777   2.18 \n 3 kickoff      25552   5.69 \n 4 no_play      42431   9.44 \n 5 pass        186677  41.5  \n 6 punt         23914   5.32 \n 7 qb_kneel      3830   0.852\n 8 qb_spike       690   0.154\n 9 run         132692  29.5  \n10 &lt;NA&gt;         12874   2.86 \n\n\nIf you watch football, you know that many games are decided by making field goals, which were 2.18% of all plays played between 2009-2018 and 83.9% of them were ‘made’.\n\nnfl_plays %&gt;% \n  filter(play_type==\"field_goal\") %&gt;%\n  count(field_goal_result) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percent=n*100/sum(n))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  field_goal_result     n percent\n  &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 blocked             196    2.00\n2 made               8206   83.9 \n3 missed             1375   14.1 \n\n\nThe average distance of the field goals ‘made’ between 2009-2018 was around 36 yards with a range of 18-64 yards. The record for the longest field goal was broken during this time frame in 2013 by Matt Prater of the Denver Broncos with a 64 yard field goal kick. Until that time, the record was 63 yards by Tom Dempsey of the New Orleans Saints in 1970. The current record is 66 yards held by Justin Tucker of the Baltimore Ravens which was kicked in the 2021 season which is outside the range of this data.

The “visiting” did have a slightly higher percentage of “missed” field goals in the closing seconds of regulation.\n\nfg_pcts &lt;- final_score %&gt;% \n  filter(play_type==\"field_goal\") %&gt;%\n  count(posteam_type,field_goal_result) %&gt;%\n  group_by(posteam_type) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percent=n*100/sum(n)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\nfg_pcts\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  posteam_type field_goal_result     n percent\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 away         blocked               1    1.02\n2 away         made                 85   86.7 \n3 away         missed               12   12.2 \n4 home         blocked               3    2.97\n5 home         made                 88   87.1 \n6 home         missed               10    9.90\n\nggplot(data=fg_pcts, aes(x=posteam_type,y=percent,fill=field_goal_result)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\",position=position_dodge()) +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Field Goals on the last play of the game\",\n       subtitle = \"for the years 2009-2018\",\n       x = \"Kicking team\",\n       y = \"Percent\") +\n  scale_fill_hue(name=\"Field Goal Result\") + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        plot.subtitle=element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        axis.line = element_line(colour = \"grey50\"))+\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,100),breaks=c(0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow close was the game when the game ended in a “field goal”? I created a “bubble plot” where each “bubble” is the proportion of games at the “kick distance” and the final score difference between the “home” and “visiting” team. A “negative” final score difference on the graph represents the “visiting” team winning the game and a “positive” final score difference represents the “home” team winning the game. If we look at the bubble plot, there was an instance where the “home” team missed the field goal and the game resulted in a “tie.” There are three instances where the score difference was greater than 5, but the majority of the games where the last play was a field goal the game was close, within 4 points of each other.\n\nfinal_score_fg &lt;- final_score %&gt;% \n  filter(play_type==\"field_goal\")\n\nfg_pcts2 &lt;- final_score_fg %&gt;% \n  filter(play_type==\"field_goal\") %&gt;%\n  count(kick_distance,score_diff,posteam_type,field_goal_result) %&gt;%\n  group_by(score_diff) %&gt;%\n  mutate(size=n*100/sum(n))\n\nfg_pcts2$category &lt;- paste(fg_pcts2$posteam_type,fg_pcts2$field_goal_result,sep=' ')\nggplot(fg_pcts2, aes(x=score_diff,y=kick_distance, size = size, color = category)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Bubble Plot of Field Goals on the last play of the game\",\n       subtitle = \"for the years 2009-2018\",\n       y = \"Kicking distance\",\n       x = \"Score Difference\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        plot.subtitle=element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        axis.line = element_line(colour = \"grey50\"))+\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(-10,4),breaks=c(-10,-8,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4))+\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,100),breaks=c(0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have looked at the overall “made” field goal distances, field goal results by team at the end of regulation and now lets take a look at the individual kickers. I came across the neat graph called a “Cleveland Dot Plot” and I thought this would be a neat way to take a look at what Field Goal Kickers have the best percentage of “made” field goals during the years 2009-2018. It looks like M. Scifres of the San Diego Chargers is 100% with only 1 field goal and S. Andrus (San Francisco 49ers) has the worst percentage of “made” field goals with only 2 out of 5 field goals or 40% ‘made’.\n\nkicker_stats &lt;- nfl_plays %&gt;% \n  filter(play_type==\"field_goal\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(kicker_player_name,field_goal_result) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total=sum(order)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  group_by(kicker_player_name) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percent=(total/sum(total))*100)\n\nkicker_stats_made &lt;- kicker_stats %&gt;% \n  filter(field_goal_result==\"made\") %&gt;%\n  arrange(percent)\n\nggplot(kicker_stats_made, aes(x = percent, y = reorder(kicker_player_name, percent))) +\n  geom_point(size = 0.5) +  \n  labs(title = \"Cleveland Dot Plot of Field Goals 'Made'\",\n       subtitle = \"by Player for the years 2009-2018\",\n       x = \"Percent\",\n       y = \"Kicker\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,100),breaks=c(0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100))+\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title=element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle=element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 1, size=5)\n  )"
