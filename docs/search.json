The data had 449,371 observations and 255 variables. Since each observation represents a play, let’s look at a frequency distribution of the different play types between 2009-2018. From the output below, 41.54% of the plays between 2009-2018 were ‘pass’ plays and 29.53% were ‘run’ plays.\n\nnfl_plays %&gt;% \n  count(play_type) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percent=n*100/sum(n))\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n   play_type        n percent\n   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 extra_point  10934   2.43 \n 2 field_goal    9777   2.18 \n 3 kickoff      25552   5.69 \n 4 no_play      42431   9.44 \n 5 pass        186677  41.5  \n 6 punt         23914   5.32 \n 7 qb_kneel      3830   0.852\n 8 qb_spike       690   0.154\n 9 run         132692  29.5  \n10 &lt;NA&gt;         12874   2.86 \n\n\nIf you watch football, you know that many games are decided by making field goals, which were 2.18% of all plays played between 2009-2018 and 83.93% of them were ‘made’.\n\nnfl_plays %&gt;% \n  filter(play_type==\"field_goal\") %&gt;%\n  count(field_goal_result) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percent=n*100/sum(n))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  field_goal_result     n percent\n  &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 blocked             196    2.00\n2 made               8206   83.9 \n3 missed             1375   14.1 \n\n\nThe average distance of the field goals ‘made’ between 2009-2018 was around 36 yards with a range of 18-64 yards. The record for the longest field goal was broken during this time frame in 2013 by Matt Prater of the Denver Broncos with a 64 yard field goal kick. Until that time, the record was 63 yards by Tom Dempsey of the New Orleans Saints in 1970. The current record is 66 yards held by Justin Tucker of the Baltimore Ravens which was kicked in the 2021 season which is outside the range of this data.
