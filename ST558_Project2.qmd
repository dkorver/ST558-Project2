# Preparing for R Shiny app development

For this project, I decided to look at the [NFL play-by-play Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016/data) for the years 2009-2018 from kaggle.com. The data had 449,371 observations and 255 variables.  Since each observation represents a play, let's look at a frequency distribution of the differnt play types between 2009-2018.   

```{r}

nfl_plays %>% 
  count(play_type) %>%
  mutate(percent=n*100/sum(n))

```
